## ðŸ“ƒ Brief Overview

A simple web application to get current weather of the city which is input by the user. The API incorporated(OpenWeatherMap API) in this web app collects the data from relevant database and fetches the information.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- This model takes in data such as temperature, precipitation and date
- On analysis, the machine learning model can identify patterns and trends that can help it make accurate predictions about future weather conditions
- We will be using a prop dataset from Kaggle with historical Weather data of various datasets which comes from a variety of Sources, such as weather stations, satellites, and radar systems.

## ðŸ’¯ Outcomes
Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions about future weather conditions based on current weather data. These predictions can be used by meteorologists, emergency responders, and other professionals to plan for and respond to weather events.

## ðŸ“ˆ Timeline 
- This project was initiated with a blank repository on 04/03/2023. 
- A simple working web app was created by the afternoon of 05/03/2023 with the functionality of fetching the live weather data of the particular city.
- 

## ðŸ¥³ What worked 
 - The app was able to fetch data, more or less, accurately
 - The UI was built successfully using the streamlit package.

## ðŸ˜¢ What didn't work
- The dataset was ready, the model was trained but its integration with the streamlit package failed and the desired product could not be completed.
-
